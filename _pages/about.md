I am a PhD student at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en) (jointly with [CGL](https://cgl.ethz.ch/) and [DisneyResearch\|Studios](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/)) I have been working on the restoration of both rendered and natural images, and my current focus is on the synthetic side. More specifically, I explore algorithms that can better reconstruct rendered images from a handful of light transport samples. 

A lot of my spare time is spent with [my girlfriend](https://mengwj.github.io) who also gives a lot of helpful advice on this website. Besides, I play 2 computer games: [minesweeper](http://www.minesweeper.info/worldranking.html) and [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home). Therefore, I can say I am somehow good at controlling the mouse. I also like to play traditional games like [Mahjong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong), [Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge) and [Scrabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble), listed in the order of my skills. I am a fan of Eason Chan, Jay Chou, Green Day and Eminem. 

Feel free to drop an [email](mailto:xyzhang.qd@gmail.com) if you are interested in what I do or play!
