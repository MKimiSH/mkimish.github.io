I am an Associate Research Scientist at [DisneyResearch\|Studios](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/) (DRS). 
My research interest is at the intersection of deep learning, image processing and image synthesis, 
particularly algorithms that can accelerate physically based rendering (PBR) or facilitate creative workflows that use PBR. 
Prior to joining DRS, I was a PhD student at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en), jointly with the [Computer Graphics Lab](https://cgl.ethz.ch/) (CGL) and DRS. I have been working on the restoration of both rendered and natural images, and my current focus is on the synthetic side. More specifically, I explore algorithms that can better reconstruct rendered images from a handful of light transport samples. 

A lot of my spare time is spent with [my girlfriend](https://mengwj.github.io) (website temporarily offline though), who researches pathways to a sustainable future. 
Besides, I play mainly 2 computer games: [minesweeper](http://www.minesweeper.info/worldranking.html) and [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home). Therefore, I can say I am somehow good at controlling the mouse. I also like to play traditional games like [Mahjong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong), [Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge) and [Scrabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble), listed in the order of my skills.  

Feel free to drop an [email](mailto:xyzhang.qd@gmail.com) if you are interested in what I do or play!
